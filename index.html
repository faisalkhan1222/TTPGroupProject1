<p>
	HyperText Markup Language, commonly abbreviated as HTML,
	 is the standard markup language used to create web pages.
	 Along with CSS, and JavaScript, HTML is a cornerstone technology
	  used to create web pages, as well as to create user interfaces for mobile
	  and web applications.</p>
		<p>
	   Web browsers can read HTML files and render them into visible or
	   audible web pages.
	    HTML describes the structure of a website semantically and,
	    before the advent of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS),
	     included cues for the presentation or
	      appearance of the document (web page), making it a markup language,
	      rather than a programming language.
			</p>


	<h2 id="css"> <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS" > CSS </a></h2>
<p>
	Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing
	the presentation of a document written in a markup language.
	Although most often used to set the visual style of web pages and
	user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML,
	the language can be applied to any XML document,
	including plain XML, SVG and XUL, and is applicable to rendering in speech,
	 or on other media. Along with HTML and JavaScript,
	 CSS is a cornerstone technology used by most websites to
	  create visually engaging webpages, user interfaces for web applications,
	   and user interfaces for many mobile applications.
</p>
		<p>

			CSS is designed primarily to enable the separation of document content
			from document presentation, including aspects such as the layout,
			 colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility,
			  provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation
			  characteristics, enable multiple HTML pages to share formatting by
			   specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file,
			   and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.

	<h2 id="python"> <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/" >Python </a></h2>
		<p>
		Python is a widely used high-level, general-purpose, interpreted,
		dynamic programming language.
		 Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability,
		 and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code
		  than possible in languages such as C++ or Java.
		   The language provides constructs intended to enable clear programs on
		   both a small and large scale.
			</p>
			<p>

				Python supports multiple programming paradigms,
				including object-oriented, imperative and functional programming
				 or procedural styles.
				 It features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management
				  and has a large and comprehensive standard library.

			</p>

			<h2 id="php"> <a href="http://php.net/docs.php" >PHP</a></h2>
				<p>
						PHP is a server-side scripting language designed for web development
						but also used as a general-purpose programming language.
						Originally created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994,
						 the PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group.
						 PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page,
						  but it now stands for the recursive backronym PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.
						</p>

						<p>

							PHP code may be embedded into HTML code,
							 or it can be used in combination with various web template systems,
							  web content management system and web frameworks.
							  PHP code is usually processed by a PHP interpreter implemented as a
							   module in the web.

						</p>

<h2 id="JavaScript"> <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference" > JavaScript </a></h2>
<p>
	JavaScript (is a high-level, dynamic, untyped,
	 and interpreted programming language.
	  It has been standardized in the ECMAScript language specification.
	   Alongside HTML and CSS, it is one of the three core technologies
	    of World Wide Web content production;
	     the majority of websites employ it and it is supported by all
	      modern Web browsers without plug-ins.
</p>

<p>
	JavaScript is prototype-based with first-class functions,
	 making it a multi-paradigm language, supporting object-oriented,
		imperative, and functional programming styles.
		 It has an API for working with text, arrays,
		 dates and regular expressions, but does not include any I/O,
			such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, relying
			for these upon the host environment in which it is embedded.

<h2 id="Cpp"> <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/" > C++ </a></h2>
<p>
	C++ is a general-purpose programming language.
	It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features,
	while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation.

</p>

<p>
	It was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded,
	resource-constrained and large systems, with performance,
	efficiency and flexibility of use as its design highlights.
	C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts,
	with key strengths being software infrastructure and
	resource-constrained applications,
	 including desktop applications,
	 servers (e.g. e-commerce, web search or SQL servers),
	 and performance-critical applications
	 (e.g. telephone switches or space probes).
	 C++ is a compiled language, with implementations of it available
	on many platforms and provided by various organizations,
	including the Free Software Foundation (FSF's GCC),
	LLVM, Microsoft, Intel and IBM.

</p>



<h2 id="java"> <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/" > JAVA </a></h2>
<p>
	Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent,
	class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as
	few implementation dependencies as possible.
	It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA),
	meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java
	 without the need for recompilation.
</p>

<p>
	Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on
	any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture..
	 As of 2016, Java is one of the most popular programming languages in use,
 particularly for client-server web applications,
 with a reported 9 million developers.
 Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems
 (which has since been acquired by Oracle Corporation)
	and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems'
	Java platform.
	The language derives much of its syntax from C and C++,
	 but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.
